===================

*The new dynamic FrontPage of dictyBase.*


---

# Introduction

Development of a dynamic framework for the dictybase using AngularJS, an open-source web application framework. The advantage of AngularJS is that the client side only requires HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The model-view-controller capability makes both development and testing easier. 

# Design principles

## FrontPage prototype

This is the initial design that we plan to accomplish. It will evolve as technology is implemented and rounds of interaction take place.
