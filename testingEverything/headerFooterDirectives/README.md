Footer Directive, minimal version
====

This folder contain a minimal version of a directive of the footer, which means that it is working without using any of the task manager and angular scaffold applications.

Two ways to run it:
- Open `index.html` with `firefox` or `safari`
- Run a local server (e.g., a python server `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
